# HotThreads
Web Development is a process that helps small businesses, present their work to the world and sell to a wider audience. With this perspective in mind, HotThreads a small clothing brand located in Ahmedabad allowed us to pick up their website project as our Semester-V Web Development Project.

Thus, this repository contains a glimpse of the project that we tried our hands-on. The HotThreads website is mainly built on languages/technologies as mentioned below:
-> HTML5
-> CSS3
-> JavaScript and Jquery
-> PHP
-> AJAX
-> Database by phyMyAdmin

This project allowed me and my team to venture into the above-mentioned frameworks. The repository refers to 4 modules that we were successful in creating from scratch, which is:   1. Homepage
  2. LoginPage/SignUp Page 
  3. Shopping Cart Page 
  4. Checkout Page

You can download and run this project after creating the given database in phpMyAdmin, and then running it on Xampp. The project works perfectly fine except for the fact that you will not be able to watch the logo as the company holds the rights to the logo and since we were out of time in our Semester-V, we were not able to create a responsive website.

We hope that this project will contribute to helping other people to build the website from the scratch.
